This program gives an input file (sk_gd.out) from
program sk_gd, and use SA method to draw the given tree.


In this version of SA we don't have any Hole.

We can have a polygonal area for drawing.
We can have fix nodes.
We can have virtual nodes.s
We Ommite virtual nodes in drawing.
We would like to add a factor to cost function to consider skeleton closeness.

OK Finished.


sa_gd.in is input file.

Note:

Matching an edge of tree with an edge of skelet does not work allways.
We have 4 situatioan:

1. An edge of Tree with an edge of Skeleton.
2. A node of Tree with an edge of Skeleton.
3. A node of Tree with a node of Skeleton.
4. An edge of Tree with a node of Skeleton.


I am working on consideration of four above states ... (22 Feb 2001) (NEW)

I try to add the support of rectilinear polygons.
I added Init_placement3 which puts non-fixed nodes of the given tree
on the location of their first fixed predecessor.

I did it. I should debug it and then start statistical experiences.
I debuged it, it is OK.

I modified the main to don't draw trees and record statistical results 
in a text file.

I should modify it to record edge-crossings, run-time, bends, edge-length 
and node-distances.
